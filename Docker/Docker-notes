What is a Container?
A container is an abstraction at the application layer that packages code and dependencies together. Instead of virtualizing the entire physical machine, containers virtualize the host operating system only.

What is a Docker Image?
Images are multi-layered self-contained files that act as the template for creating containers. They are like a frozen, read-only copy of a container. Images can be exchanged through registries.

What is a Docker Registry?
An image registry is a centralized place where you can upload your images and can also download images created by others. Docker Hub is the default public registry for Docker.
